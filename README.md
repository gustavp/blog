Personal blog
====

After some very frustrating experiences with wordrpress, tumblr, posterous and various other blogging tools, I've decided to roll a simpler version of my personal blog using a toolchain more suited to my idiosyncratic tastes. 

This blog is mostly for personal reflection, experiments and links to projects that I admire or enjoy. If you have landed here by some accident looking or my work at the Praekelt Group, please visit www.twitter.com/gustavp, www.praekelt.com or www.praekeltfoundation.org for news and information about how we use mobile to enhance lives in Africa. 

There are also some very cool videos of our work here: http://www.youtube.com/praekeltfoundation

I'll be using this Readme file to track progress (hopefully) of the blog.
