Personal blog
===========

After some very frustrating experiences with wordrpress, tumblr, posterous and various other blogging tools, I've decided to roll a simpler version of my personal blog using a toolchain more suited to my idiosyncratic tastes. 

Praekelt Group
-------------------
This blog is mostly for personal reflection, experiments and links to projects that I admire or enjoy. If you have landed here by some wild accident and want to know more about what I do for a living please visit:

JoziHub

I'm also involved in JoziHub, a technology incubator in Johannesburg dedicated to creating sustainable change in Africa. Find out more about how we are helping to develop the next generation of young entrepreneurs in Africa here:
