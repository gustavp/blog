Personal blog
=============

After some very frustrating experiences with wordrpress, tumblr, posterous and various other blogging tools, I've decided to roll a simpler version of my personal blog using a toolchain more suited to my idiosyncratic tastes. 

This blog is mostly for personal reflection, experiments and links to projects that I admire or enjoy. If you have landed here by some wild accident and want to know more about what I do for a living please visit:

- www.praekelt.com 
- www.praekeltfoundation.org 
for news and information about how we build mobile experiences to enhance lives in Africa. 

JoziHub
-------
I'm also involved in the JoziHub, a technology incubator in Johannesburg dedicated to creating sustainable change in Africa. Find out more about how we are helping to develop the next generation of young entrepreneurs in Africa here: www.jozihub.org

I'll be using this Readme file to track progress (hopefully) of the blog.
